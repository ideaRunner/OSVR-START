#Software Preparation
There is the official [download page](http://osvr.github.io/using/). If you want to save time and do not download from official page, you can download at my [Github](https://github.com/ideaRunner/OSVR-Start).

1. **OSVR Runtime for Windows**  
   * OSVR Runtime installer includes everything you need to get OSVR up and running (not for development, but everything for running)  
   * Click [**Download**](http://access.osvr.com/binary/osvr-runtime-installer) to enter the download page.
   * Choose the newest core version that is listed first. Make sure the software bits are matching your system. 
   * Click and then begin to download OSVR Runtime.  
2. **No need to Download OSVR SDK for Windows**  
   * If you only want to run OSVR HDK2 to play some demos or games, **No** need to download *OSVR SDK*, Otherwise you can click and download at [this page](http://osvr.github.io/using/).
3. **OSVR HDK Windows Driver Pack**  
   * These are drivers for OSVR HDK2.
