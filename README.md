#OSVR_Quick_Start
##Please Note

This is a step-by-step tutorial that how to quickly start OSVR HDK2.  
My graphic card is GTX1060, deriver version is 376.xx and operating system is Windows10.  
This article also can help those persons who use high Nvidia GPU driver version.  
The official getting start tutorial you can find [Here](https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Docs). There is a official instruction of [GPU driver](https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Docs/blob/master/Troubleshooting/RenderManager.md#compatible-gpu-drivers) 

#Software Preparation
There is the official [download page](http://osvr.github.io/using/). If you want to save time and do not download from official page, you can download at my [github](https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Docs/blob/master/Getting-Started/Installing/windows.md). But the version is not the newest.

1. **OSVR Runtime for Windows**  
   * OSVR Runtime installer includes everything you need to get OSVR up and running (not for development, but everything for running)  
   * Click [**Download**](http://access.osvr.com/binary/osvr-runtime-installer) to enter the download page.
   * Choose the newest core version that is listed first. Make sure the software bits are matching your system. 
   * Click and then begin to download OSVR Runtime.  
2. ** No need to Download *OSVR SDK for Windows***  
   * If you only want to run OSVR HDK2 to play some demos or games, **No** need to download *OSVR SDK*, Otherwise you can click and download at [this page](http://osvr.github.io/using/).
3. **OSVR HDK Windows Driver Pack**  
   * These are drivers for OSVR HDK2.
   * Click [**Download**](https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-HDK-Windows-Drivers/releases) to enter the download page.
   * If you want to run or play first, you can select the newest version of combined driver (exe file). Example: *OSVR-HDK-Combined-Driver-Installer-1.2.8.exe* 
   * No need to download other files such as *Source Code* or *inf file*.
4. **SteamVR-OSVR**  
   * It is a very important tool to use OSVR HDK2. Without it we may have some problems with direct mode and extend mode because of our higher GPU driver version.
   * [Official page](https://github.com/OSVR/SteamVR-OSVR) and [Download page](https://bintray.com/osvr/SteamVR-OSVR/SteamVR-OSVR-Win/v0.1-296-g7011d81-core-v0.6-1935-ga2cba4b6#files)
   * You can download it at **Files** column. It is a *7z* Compressed file.
